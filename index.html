                <h2>Swami ji of India</h2>
                <p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, <b>Vivekananda</b> was inclined from a young 
                    age towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk. After 
                    the death of Ramakrishna, <b>Vivekananda</b> extensively toured the Indian subcontinent acquiring first-hand
                    knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he 
                    resolved to help his countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a 
                    popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered his famous 
                    speech beginning with the words: "Sisters and brothers of America ..." while introducing Hinduism to
                    Americans. He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an 
                    orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament".
                    After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, <b>Vivekananda</b> delivered hundreds of 
                    lectures across the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu 
                    philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco 
                    (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta 
                    Societies in the West. In India, <b>Vivekananda</b> founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual 
                    training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, which provides charity,
                    social work and education.</p>
